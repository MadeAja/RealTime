A PMMP plugin that cycles in-game time as in real life.

`day_start_time` <i> Specifies when a day starts at. [e.g: 8 = 8 AM , 13 = 1 PM] Minimum: 0 , Maximum: 23. </i>

## Commands

`/realtime`  (`/rt`) are the main commands

`/rt enable` will enable the time checking by setting `enableTimeChange` in `config.yml` to true.

`/rt disable` will disable the time checking by setting `enableTimeChange` in `config.yml` to false.
